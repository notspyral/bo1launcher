# BO1 Launcher

I'm back with another pointless app!

BO1 Launcher is a python application which lets you choose between BO1 and BO1 multiplayer in one menu. This menu supports opening through Steam, and provides instructions to do so.

**DISCLAIMER: This app stops working if the game opens the safe mode window, in order to solve this you would need to open Black Ops or Black Ops Multiplayer manually and click out of the safe mode warning in order for the app to work.**
